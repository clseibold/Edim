# Introduction

EdimCoder is a line editor much like Ed. This means it manipulates one line at a time. However, because of the technology we have today, we don't have to settle for the minimalism and software limitations that Ed had. Therefore, EdimCoder provides various means of making text-editing easier with its line-editing style. This includes prompts, status lines, and context information for each command, among other things.
